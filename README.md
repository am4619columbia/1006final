# 1006final
Final project for 1006

I used a lot of Evan's template code to get the initial website up and running. Then I was just playing around with the
colors and learned how to make tables in html after a little bit of googling. I also rememberd Prof. Paine's tip to use 
pandas to make html data tables, so I did that as well. All in all I kept it pretty simple and just added a classes and 
assignments page!
